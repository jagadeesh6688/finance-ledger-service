# Financial Transaction Ledger Backend â€” Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Objective:**  
Build a backend service for an organization to manage financial transaction ledgers across multiple branches, employees, and vendors, with strong Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC).  
Tech stack: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, Apollo Server 5.

---

## 1. **Business Requirements**

- **Organization Structure**

  - Support an organization with multiple branches.
  - Each branch has employees, a manager/designation hierarchy.
  - Employees report to managers (can cross branches).
  - Designations must be mapped to clear permission levels.

- **Financial Transactions**

  - Track _all_ internal transactions: deposits, withdrawals, transfers, settlements.
  - Support transactions with external vendors (purchase, refunds, payments).
  - Employees can record their own expenses (linked to vendor and branch).
  - Enable team managers to review/approve/reject employee expenses.

- **Vendor Management**

  - Register vendors with contact info.
  - Link each vendor to relevant transactions and payments.
  - Enable querying vendor-specific ledgers.

- **Ledger & Reporting**

  - Provide a complete ledger for every entity: employee, branch, organization, vendor.
  - Support trend/aggregate queries (expense summaries, outstanding balances, settlements).

- **RBAC & Security**
  - Define roles: Admin, Branch Manager, Employee, Vendor.
  - Enforce role-based permissions for every GraphQL query and mutation.
  - Permissions must be validated at resolver/middleware level.
  - Audit/track unauthorized attempts.

## 2. **Functional Requirements**

- **Schemas**

  - Organization: name, branches (ref), createdAt, updatedAt.
  - Branch: name, employees (ref), manager (ref), parentOrg (ref).
  - Employee: name, userId, designation, branch (ref), manager (ref), permissions, expenses (ref), createdAt.
  - Vendor: name, contactInfo, transactions (ref), createdAt.
  - Transaction: amount, type (credit/debit/refund/purchase), reference (employee/branch/vendor), description, createdAt, updatedAt.

- **API Endpoints (GraphQL)**

  - CRUD for all entities: organization, branch, employee, vendor, transaction.
  - Aggregation queries: expenses by branch, employee, vendor.
  - RBAC-protected mutations: only permitted roles may perform certain updates.
  - Authentication and session endpoints.

- **Utils/Handles**

  - Error handling: standardized, centralized.
  - Input validation: types, required fields, sanitization.
  - Permissions: reusable RBAC check utilities.

- **Testing**
  - 90%+ code coverage for all business and permission logic.
  - Unit tests: model validation, permissions, error cases.
  - Integration tests: CRUD flows, aggregate queries and RBAC boundaries.

---

## 3. **Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Performance:**
  - Indexes on all major schema reference fields.
  - File line limits enforced for maintainability.
- **Scalability:**
  - Modular codebase split into logical folders: models, graphql, utils, handles, tests.
- **Documentation:**
  - JSDoc for all functions, comprehensive README, API schema docs, RBAC matrix table.
- **Security:**
  - Input checks, permission validation at all resolver entrypoints, audit logging.

---

## 4. **Acceptance Criteria**

- CRUD operations for all entities, validated on input and permission.
- RBAC in place: unauthorized access/edits are blocked and logged.
- Aggregation queries return accurate, branch-wise and vendor-wise ledgers.
- Test suite passes all core flows and edge cases.
- Documentation complete with frontend handover guides and schema diagrams.

---

## 5. **Future Extensions & Notes**

- Frontend integration via GraphQL, RBAC-powered login and operations.
- Customizable permissions/roles for new branches/employees.
- API playground and schema explorer for rapid onboarding.
